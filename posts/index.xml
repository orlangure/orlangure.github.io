      <description>I have a friend who happens to be a huge fan of Apple products. He also hates Vim. He has quite a few stories about how awful Vim is, and how many problems it causes.

      <description>I love learning new stuff. There are tons of things I&amp;rsquo;d like to read, understand and remember. I&amp;rsquo;m sure such attitude helps me to constantly improve myself and grow professionally.
