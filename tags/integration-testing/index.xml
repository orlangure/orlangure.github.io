      <description>Gnomock had a very extensive test suite since the very beginning. The tests ran on Github Actions and CircleCI platforms, on Linux, to make sure that both CI/CD platforms are properly supported. After all, Gnomock is used during CI, and not only locally.</description>

      <description>I like writing integration tests for my Go code. They give me confidence that everything works as expected. This was one of the reasons I built Gnomock (an integration and end-to-end toolkit based on Docker): to easily write tests for code that uses databases or other external services, like AWS S3 or Splunk.</description>
